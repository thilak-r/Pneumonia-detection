# Pneumonia Detection ü©∫

## **Project Overview**
This project is a deep learning-based system designed to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. By leveraging the power of **ResNet18** architecture, the model classifies X-ray images as either **Normal** or **Pneumonia** with high accuracy. The system is built to aid healthcare professionals in making accurate diagnoses quickly and effectively.

## **Key Features**
- **Deep Learning-Powered**: Utilizes **ResNet18**, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture.
- **Binary Classification**: Classifies X-ray images into two categories: **Normal** and **Pneumonia**.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Drag-and-drop functionality with an additional "Choose File" option for uploading images.
- **Performance Metrics**: Includes confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve for detailed performance evaluation.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Provides instant predictions with confidence scores for uploaded X-ray images.
